# Conway's Game of Languages
---
This repository contains a implementation for [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in multiple languages.

## Goal
Here I'm trying to learn and test my own skills in programming. As I want to do this project in multiple languages. Hell, I likely don't know a bit about to begin with. Thus I will do something that might be pretty simple but not to easy.



## Disclaimer
Keep in mind that this a project where I just want to learn or try my skills in a variety of languages. As a result, my code won't be the best, but that's not what I want to show/try here.
